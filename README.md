# blackhat-go

These are my implementations of the various really cool tools from the book [Black Hat Go](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Go-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593278659).

Each folder (package) from the root of the repository would contain a `main.go` file that has the final implementation I am comfortable with. The other packages inside each would contain different experimental implementations.

Most part of the source code are gotten from the [Black Hat Go book](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Go-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593278659).
